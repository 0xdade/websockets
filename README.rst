``websockets`` is an implementation of `RFC 6455`_, the WebSocket protocol,
with a focus on simplicity and correctness.

It relies on the `Tulip`_ library, which prefigurates Python's `asynchronous
IO support`_, and requires Python â‰¥ 3.3.

.. _RFC 6455: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455
.. _Tulip: http://code.google.com/p/tulip/
.. _asynchronous IO support: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3156/

The documentation is available at https://websockets.readthedocs.org/.
