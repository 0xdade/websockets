``websockets`` is an implementation of `RFC 6455`_, the WebSocket protocol,
with a focus on simplicity and correctness.

It's built on top on Python's asynchronous I/O features described in `PEP
3156`_.

It requires Python â‰¥ 3.4 or Python 3.3 with a copy of the ``asyncio`` module
available in the `Tulip`_ repository.

It passes the `Autobahn Testsuite`_.
