``websockets`` is an implementation of `RFC 6455`_, the WebSocket protocol,
with a focus on simplicity and correctness.

It relies on the `Tulip`_ library, which will become the standard for
`asynchronous I/O`_ in future versions of Python, and requires Python â‰¥ 3.3.

It passes the `Autobahn Testsuite`_.
